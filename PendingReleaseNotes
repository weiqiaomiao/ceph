======

* The rbd CLI no longer accepts the deprecated '--image-features' option
  during create, import, and clone operations.  The '--image-feature'
  option should be used instead.

* The 'send_pg_creates' and 'map_pg_creates' mon CLI commands are
  obsolete and no longer supported.

* A new configure option 'mon_election_timeout' is added to specifically
  limit max waiting time of monitor election process, which was previously
  restricted by 'mon_lease'.
